# --- Architect's Note ---
# This file dictates line-ending strategy for the entire repo.
# It ensures cross-platform consistency and silences CRLF/LF warnings.

# Auto-detect text files and normalize all line endings to LF (Unix-style)
# This is the modern, cross-platform standard.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly declare files that MUST be LF (Unix scripts)
*.sh eol=lf
*.bash_profile eol=lf

# Explicitly declare files that SHOULD be LF (even on Windows)
# This enforces a single, consistent line-ending for all text scripts.
*.ps1 eol=lf

# Mark binary files as binary so Git doesn't try to change them
*.zip binary
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
